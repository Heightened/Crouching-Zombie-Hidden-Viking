\chapter{Game-play}

In this chapter we will discuss the flow and goal of the game as well as some additional mechanics that will add additional challenges. We will also briefly give an overview how we intend to immerse the player into the game.

\section{Setup}
The player gets a number of vikings assigned to him/her. Zombies will randomly spawn and try to prevent the player from completing missions. The map is loitered with a myriad of items players can use to fight the zombies.

\section{Goals}
The goal of the game is to have at least one viking survive as long as possible. Completing missions are essential to survival as they allow you to restock on resources, gain new weapons and extra vikings. The player loses the game if all the vikings are killed by the zombies or a short while after resources are depleted.

\section{Additional mechanics}
Lighting street lights or campfires allow the player to see further into the darkness and slows down zombies. The vikings can use motorcycles to move around faster. Vikings can pick up weapons randomly scattered across the map. Zombies can also use bikes and weapons after a certain level for an additional challenge.

\section{Immersion}
Initially we want to give the player a false sense of security. You control these mighty vikings and are up against brainless undead. These undead will however become more sophisticated over time and thus surprise the player with feats that were previously not thought possible.
