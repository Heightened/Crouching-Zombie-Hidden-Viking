\chapter{Architectural design}
In this section we will explain our architectural desicions for Crouching Zombie Hidden Viking. The architecture is based off the model view controller diagram proposed on the course website. We found that the architecture as it was proposed did not work well for us. It was unclear what the purpose of the simulator was in the original proposal and the ideas that were clarified were unsuitable for our purposes. Second because of the graphics library we used and time constraints for the implementation some extra coupling between classes was unavoidable.
