\section{Movement}
In this section, we introduce everything related to character movement we will have in our game, along with some considerations and plans that did not make it in yet. The most integral point to the movement in any real-time strategy game is path finding, for navigating the map, so we start with that. For our game, we want the movement to look smooth, so we thought of ways to follow paths in a non-trivial and good-looking way, as described in the second subsection. Finally, we tried to put in some other movement schemes that do not require the process of path finding and give some more variety to the movement, which will be discussed in the last subsection here.
