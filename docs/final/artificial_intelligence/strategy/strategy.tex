\section{Strategy}

The vikings will be controlled by human players. For the zombies to be a worthy opponent, they should show some intelligence. More or stronger zombies will make for a boring game.

\subsection{zombie minds}
Zombies will each have an individual AI. We will try to limit the amount of shared data.

\subsection{Leadership}
In order for the zombies to achieve some kind of strategies each AI can choose a leader to follow. A leader can control his followers until the follower decides to stop following. A command can simply be ``do what I'm doing''. Since followers can have followers of their own, zombies will create tree like hierarchies.

Zombies with a small amount of followers (direct and indirect) will have a higher likelihood of following a leader, because on it's own, the group can't achieve much. zombies with a large amount of followers can choose to give some subtrees different command in order to execute a command from it's leader, or strategy he decided to execute himself.
